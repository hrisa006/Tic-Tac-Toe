# Tic-Tac-Toe

A small but realistic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React.js and CSS for styling as a web application. The project allows it to be played by two people.

## Features
- **Edit Name**: Sets name for each of the players.
- **Show Turns**: Highlighting the player's name indicates that it is their turn to place a symbol (X, O) on the game board.
- **History List**: Displays each move's location in the format (row, col) as a list.
- **Game Over**: Notes the name of the winning player and prompts for a new game.
- **Rematch**: Loads a new game board and resets the move history list.
